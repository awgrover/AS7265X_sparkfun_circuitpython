# AS7265X_sparkfun_micropython
CircuitPython driver for the AS7265X 18-channels spectral sensor

This is a python library for the AS7265X 18-channels spectral sensor designed to operate with Sparkfun's boards. It is based on 
[NPC1399's circuitpython library](https://github.com/NPC1399/AS7265X_sparkfun_micropython) which was based on
SparkFun_AS7265x_Arduino_Library : https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_AS7265x_Arduino_Library.
